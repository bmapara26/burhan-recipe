    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Marinade the chicken: Cut the chicken thighs into Â½ inch thick strips and 
            add to a large bowl. Add the chipotle sauce, honey, lime juice, garlic 
            paste, sazon, paprika and oregano and toss everything together to fully 
            coat the chicken pieces in marinade. Let sit for at least 30 minutes and 
            up to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the chicken marinades make your yellow rice: Heat a pot over medium 
            high and melt the ghee, add the washed rice, then the sazon, bouillon 
            powder and turmeric. Toast the rice and spices for 1 minute or until 
            fragrant and any liquid from the rice has evaporated. Add in 2 cups of 
            water and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cover tightly with
             a lid. Cook the rice according to the package instructions or until all 
             the liquid is absorbed and the rice is easily fluffed with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the sauce: To a blender, add the sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic, 
            chipotle sauce, honey, lime juice, salt, pepper, paprika and oregano and 
            blend until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings then transfer to a squeeze 
            bottle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the chicken: Heat a large skillet over medium high and add about 1 
            Tbsp of ghee or oil. Once hot, add the chicken in one even layer and let 
            cook undisturbed for 2 minutes. Stir and flip the chicken so it browns on 
            all sides, about 1 minute, then add in the chopped onion for the last 4-5 
            minutes of cooking. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to assemble.
        </li>
        <li>
            Build your bowl: Layer rice on the bottom of a serving bowl, then add a 
            layer of cooked chicken and onions along with diced tomato and shredded 
            lettuce. Drizzle everything with chipotle cream sauce and serve.
